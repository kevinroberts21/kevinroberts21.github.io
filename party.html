									<h6>Maid of Honor</h6>
									<p>Jenna is my younger sister and my first friend.  We have grown closer as we have gotten older. We share a love for animals, movies and television. We are constantly quoting lines from movies or our favorite TV shows to make each other laugh. Jenna is one of the strongest people I know and is beautiful inside and out. Not to mention, she is “most smartest.” She is currently living in Austin, TX and working as a Promotions Director and Digital Content Manager at a radio station.</p>

									<h6>Maid of Honor</h6>
				 					<p>Ashley and I met when we were in kindergarten and have kept the friendship going ever since. I am very fortunate to have maintained such a close friendship for so long. She has shown me what it means to be a good friend and has been there for me countless times. She is not only caring, reliable, and funny, but we can go days without speaking to each other and pick up right where we left off. We have a sisterly bond, and I cannot imagine my life without her. She is working as a research associate at a biotech company called Stemcentrx in San Francisco.</p>
